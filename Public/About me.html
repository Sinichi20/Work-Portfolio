            <p>Hello! I'm Shiva Cruz, a dedicated and passionate Computer Science student at Map√∫a University. 
              My journey in technology started when I was 7 years old, when I first saw Iron Man I on the cinemas. It amazed me, wanting to become like Tony, I explore and learn about 
              Robotics, Articial Intelligence, our Economy, and many others. Since then, I've been deeply immersed in the world of data science and software development, 
              constantly exploring new technologies and methodologies to broaden my expertise.</p>
